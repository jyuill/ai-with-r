## LLM: Interpret Images

```{r setup}
# load libraries
library(ellmer)
library(here)

# set llm client
client <- client <- chat_openai(system_prompt=sys_prompt,
model = "gpt-4o-mini"
)

# set file path for image
img_01 <- here("IMG_4856.JPEG")
```

Simple example - may be limited ability, depending on model, question.

```{r}
# prompt for image info:
client$chat(
    "Is this an indoor or outdoor photo?",
    content_image_file(img_01, resize="low")
)
```

## LLM: Structured Output from Images

Simple example.

```{r}
# structured info from images
# set up json structure
image_info = type_object(
    subject = type_string("The main subject of the image"),
    setting = type_string("Whether the image setting is indoors or outdoors or other observations on setting"),
    colors = type_array("Major colors present in the image",
        type_string()
    )
)
```

```{r}
client$chat_structured(
    "Tell me about this image in the specified format.",
    content_image_file(img_01, resize="low"),
    type = image_info
)
```
